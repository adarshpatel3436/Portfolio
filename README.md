# Adarsh Patel - Personal Portfolio Website 🚀

This is my first personal portfolio website, built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information effectively in a clean, modern, single-page layout.

As a budding developer, this project serves as a comprehensive representation of my abilities in core frontend and introductory backend concepts.
